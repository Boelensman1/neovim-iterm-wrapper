# neovim-iterm-wrapper
Enables you to use the console version of neovim in iTerm2 as a app.

Advantages of this is that neovim will start behaving like a normal app which allows you to use things like "open with".

Only tested on Mac OSX El Capitan and with iTerm Beta Build 3.0.4, will not work with iTerm version before that
